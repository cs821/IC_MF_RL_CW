# IC_MF_RL_CW: Deep Hedging with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the code implementation for the **Advanced Machine Learning (MATH70120)** coursework, focusing on **Deep Hedging** using **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** and **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**.  

The goal of this coursework is to explore reinforcement learning approaches for hedging financial derivatives. The implementation follows standard deep reinforcement learning frameworks and utilizes **DDPG** for deterministic policy optimization and **SAC** for entropy-regularized exploration. The code is designed to replicate and analyze the performance of these algorithms in hedging tasks, considering different market dynamics and transaction costs.  

Certain components, such as the **environment setup and replay buffer**, take inspiration from [tdmdal/rl-hedge-2019](https://github.com/tdmdal/rl-hedge-2019), with necessary modifications for this coursework. The repository includes scripts for training, testing, and evaluating the models under different financial market conditions.
